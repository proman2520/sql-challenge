# sql-challenge

This README is to help navigate the repository. The folder labeled 'data' contains the six .csv files necessary to complete this assignment. 
ERD.jpg is an image of my Entity Relationship Diagram from QuickDBD. The .sql file 'sql_schemata.sql' is the file containing the SQL code 
that created the tables with their correct variables prior to importing the .csv data. 'sql_queries.sql' is the file which contains the 
SQL code necessary to list the required information per the rubric. In other words, the queries requested by the assignment are satisfied 
by the code in that file.

I felt behind in class but caught up to do this assignment. I consulted the Zoom sessions, AskBCS (which wasn't too helpful this time), 
and additionally I consulted my sister (who codes for her job in SQL) about basic questions, mostly related to typical syntax conventions.

Thank you for taking the time to grade my assignment, I greatly appreciate it.
